# This repository contains the source code and the results of the computational experiments developed for my undergraduate thesis on biometric recognition systems.

## Description
The project consists of four Python notebooks that contain the implementation and the results of the experiments conducted in different stages of the research.

`ear.ipynb`: This notebook contains the implementation of the model and the experiments for recognition based on the subject's ear.

`face.ipynb`: This notebook contains the implementation of the model and the experiments for recognition based on the subject's face.

`dataset.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code for generating a synthetic database based on two other databases, one of ear samples and the other of face samples.

`combine.ipynb`: This notebook contains the implementation of the model and the experiments for combining the probabilities of the other two models into one, producing a single result.

## Requirements
To run the notebooks, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV

## Usage
You can download or clone the repository to your local machine and open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.

Note: The datasets used in this project are not included in the repository. However, you can find them online on the author's page.
